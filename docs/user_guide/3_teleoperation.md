# Teleoperation system

This documentation describes the setup of a Shadow Tele-operation system. The system links the Shadow Dexterouns Hand, the capable UR10 Robot Arm, the [CyberGlove](http://www.cyberglovesystems.com/) and a [Vive wrist tracker](https://www.vive.com/eu/), to provide end-to-end control of dexterous manipulation from human movement.
