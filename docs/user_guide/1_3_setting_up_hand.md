## Connecting Cables
There are two ways to connect the EtherCAT and power cables to the hand.

### External connections
If your hand already has cables fitted, then you can simply connect the EtherCAT and power connectors immediately.

**EtherCAT**: Connect the Ethernet cable to the hand's Ethernet socket, and connect the other end to the PC's second
Ethernet port. **If you have a Bi-manual system, connect the Left and Right hands correctly to the labelled ports.**
You have been supplied with a medium length Ethernet lead, but if you require a longer or shorter one, you can simply use a standard commercial Ethernet Cat 5 cable, available from most computer parts suppliers.

**Power**: Connect the external power supply to the hand using the metal Lemo connector, making sure to line up the red dots. If you require a longer or shorter cable, please contact the Shadow Robot Company.

### Internal connections
If you are connecting the hand to a robot with internal cabling, then you may wish to use the internal connectors.
Turn the hand over, and use the orange and green hex drivers to remove the connector cover. Connect the two cables to their relevant sockets. Now affix the hand to the robot arm.

## Mounting the hand

Use the elbow adaptor plate supplied to adapt the Hand to the UR robot arm and mount the hand.

## Powering up

You can power up the hand and PC in any order. You do not have to power up one before the other. When power is applied to the hand, the fans will be heard immediately.

### Lights

On power up, the lights will be in the following state

=======================   =============       ================    =================================
```

Lights will also appear inside the base, indicating 5v, 6v and 24v (or 28v) supplies. These can only be seen by removing the covers.

### Jiggling

This applies to the motor hand only. On reset, all of the strain gauges (torque sensors) in the
motors need to be zeroed. This happens automatically. The motors are driven back and forth
to try to relieve any tension on the tendons. Then both gauges are zeroed. You will therefore
see all joints of the hand move slightly on power up or reset or power up.
