```eval_rst
.. Note:: Follow this documentation if you have a table provided by Shadow. Otherwise, it should be a sturdy surface strong enough to withstand at least 10 times the arm's weight.
```

Unpack the demo table and assemble it as per the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7asK4RDGCPR3rHt41VwS1oK7yD3LbegnAYJhy3luhU/edit).
