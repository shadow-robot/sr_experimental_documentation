## Setting up the table (If you have a table provided by Shadow)
Unpack the demo table and assemble it as per the instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7asK4RDGCPR3rHt41VwS1oK7yD3LbegnAYJhy3luhU/edit).

If you don't have a table provided by Shadow, it should be sturdy surface strong enough to withstand at least 10 times the arm's weight.
